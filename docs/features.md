# Key Features â€“ PocketLoRA

PocketLoRA enables **on-device fine-tuning** of billion-parameter scale LLMs on consumer-grade smartphones (Galaxy S23â€“S25 class).  
Below are the salient highlights of our approach:

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

### ðŸ”‹ Low-Power Fine-Tuning
- Runs **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)** directly on-device.  
- Optimized with **NF4 quantization + gradient checkpointing**.  
- Training only activates under **safe conditions** (charging + Wi-Fi + cool temperature).

---

### ðŸ”Œ Hot-Swap Adapters
- Train **small, task-specific adapters** (a few MBs) instead of full models.  
- Users can **enable/disable adapters at runtime** (no restart required).  
- Export adapters for reuse or sharing across devices.

---

### ðŸ”’ On-Device Privacy
- All training happens **locally on the phone**, ensuring **personal data never leaves the device**.  
- Ideal for personal email tone adaptation, summarization of private notes, and personalized assistants.

---

### âš¡ Optimized Runtime
- Integrates with **ExecuTorch / ONNX Runtime Mobile** for low-latency inference.  
- Smart **memory scheduler** ensures no interference with other apps.  
- Works under the **tight RAM budget (12â€“16GB)** of flagship smartphones.

---

### ðŸ“± User-Friendly App
- **Training Screen** â†’ select dataset, track training progress.  
- **Adapters Screen** â†’ manage multiple adapters, enable/disable, export.  
- **Inference Screen** â†’ test LLM responses in real time with active adapter.
